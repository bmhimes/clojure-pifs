# clojure-pifs

A Clojure library designed to store and retrieve data from digits of pi!  The advantage to this code is the extremely high compression ratio.  The disadvantage is the extremely high, unpredictable compression time.  Think of this as a very special form of archive.

## Usage

None (yet)

## To do

- Implement Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe-Algorithm
- Research iterative algorithms for possible speed increase, given a starting digit and position
- Search for data in pi
- Store position and length data
- Create file (decompress) from position and length data
- Implement actors for multithreaded compression
